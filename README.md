# Minesweeper

Reimplementation of the minesweeper game

## How to run (only tested for Windows 10)
Go to https://github.com/MaximeDeroin/minesweeper/releases, download and unzip the latest version.
You can open the game by double clicking on _play_minesweeper.bat_ or by executing minesweeper.exe (in the files folder)

## How to build and run in QtCreator
To build and run the project, you need to install the latest version of QtCreator(https://www.qt.io/download), and clone the repository(git@github.com:MaximeDeroin/minesweeper.git).

In QtCreator select _"Open File or Project"_ and then select the _"src/minesweeper.pro"_ file.
Then click the run button (Or Build/Run in the top menu).

## How to play
On the first screen, you can choose the parameters of the game with the sliders. When you are ready, click _"Play"_!
You must click on all the cells with no mine to win!
You can right click on a cell if you know there is a mine under it, it will lock the cell, so you don't accidentally click it. To unlock it, you must right click on the cell once again.

You can reset the game by clicking _"Start new game"_ or change the game parameters via _"Return to menu"_.
